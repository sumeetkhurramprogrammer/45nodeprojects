//Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.


//program 1 having Comments

// Store your favorite number in a variable
let favoriteNumber: number = 7;

// Create a message revealing your favorite number
let message: string = "My favorite number is=" + (favoriteNumber);

// Print the message
console.log(message);

//program 2 having Comments

// Store the names of your friends in an array called names
let names: string[] = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"];

// Print each person's name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time
for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
    console.log(names[i]);
}
