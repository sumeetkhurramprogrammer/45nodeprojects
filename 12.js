//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
let names = ["Ali", "Bilal", "Sumeet", "Dawood"];
// Print a personalized message to each person
for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
    console.log("Hello," + (names[i]) + "! Have a great day!");
}
export {};
