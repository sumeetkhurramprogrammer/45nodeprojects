//Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let myList: string[] = ["Mount Everest", "Amazon River", "Effile Towor"];

// Print the list
console.log("My List:",myList);
